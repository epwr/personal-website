            <p className="title-2">About Me</p>
            <p>As a developer, I am passionate about securing data properly and automating workflows. I believe that software can
            help everyone increase the impact of their work, but that you need to build systems that do the basics properly. No
            one will trust your systems to give them accurate data if you can't protect that data.  </p>
            <p>As a human being, I care about how our technology affects our society. From democratizing knowledge to the rise of 
            purposeful misinformation, we can see that technologies are not value neutral. How technologies are built matters because
            it allows and incentivizes how they are used.</p>
            <p>I have a B.Sc. in Computer Science from the University of Victoria, where I focused on how to understand and predict the 
            affects that software systems can have on our society.</p>
