Hey, my name is Eric. I'm a developer who cares about privacy, simplicity, and speed. 


I build products that I would use, so that means I focus two things: ease of use and speed. I want all the functionality that I will use to be easy to discover and easy to use, without having to wait a couple seconds for each page to load.

The race to the bottom isn't a healthy business model; build something I want to use, and price at a place that let's you keep improving it, and I'll pay the premium. 




I think that the web 1.0 had one central idea that was pretty amazing; it was decentralized. SMTP, RSS, HTTP, the list goes on. When the web is built on top of open protocols, rather than closed platforms, you let users choose how they interact with the web. I get the barriers to entry are valuable for the Amazons and Facebooks of the world, but they aren't good for you or I.

If you are look for help building products that respect your users privacy, and you don't rely on having a monopoly to be profitable, let me know. I'd love to talk about how I can help.
