# README - Website

This is a folder to experiment with ideas for a personal website. Everything here is static and would be moved to a rails site before heading to production.

## Visual Ideas

Per Paul Jarvis (Fathom Analytics) blue and green are the main colours used by coders in designs. Don't use them. The episode "Why do programmers suck at design?" of their podcast (Above Board) is really good on design.

Thinking a nice yellow with white and black might be nice. Or maybe a brown. 

## Content Ideas


### School Notes

This site would hold all the PDFs (and LaTex) files for the notes from CSC370, CSC330, CSC360, CSC361, and SENG 480B.

What do my CSC 320 notes look like? Maybe those as well.

### Links

Some links to:
	- LinkedIn

### Podcast

Once the podcast site is set up, it would include that. The rss feed might be from ericpower.ca so that I don't need to maintain pillarsofourpast.com forever. Actually, the whole pillars site might be at ericpower.ca/pillars and the domain would just redirect.

### Blog

A blog with articles about creating the podcast and the website. Article ideas:
	- Learning the basics of Rails
		1. Learn Ruby basics (see my notes from CSC 330)
		2. Learn the MVC pattern and the idea of routes.
		3. Explore migration and generation
	- Privacy (the thought behind my privacy policy).

## Privacy Ideas

### Google FLoC

Fathom has an article about Google's new FLoC cohort tracking which is gross. There's a way to request it be turned off by setting up a field in the HTTP header. Learn how to do this with Rails.

### Privacy Policy

Would really have four parts:
	1. Why I think that privacy is important.
	2. What I will track and how I can use it (page visits to understand what people think is important, bucketed data on when people visit).
	3. What I will not do with this (every sell/share the data points).
	4. What I would do if I needed to change this policy.
