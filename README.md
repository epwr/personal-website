# Personal Website

My personal website is at ericpower.ca and serves as my home on the web! This repo holds the source code for it, and the website is served via AWS Amplify. The blog is powered by a Postgres database that is served via AWS RDS.

## To-Dos

A few to-dos for the website:
	- Connect the Blog page to the AWS RDS that stores the blog pages.
	- Add in a 'report' button on the 404 page (that sends an INSERT query to a table).
