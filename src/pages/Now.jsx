            <p>After wrapping up my degree, I've enjoyed a short break where I worked on a couple projects and had some fun in nature! In the last two months I've
            finished writting a custom programming language, designed and built a deck for my parents, learned Clojure, read extensively (mostly 19th century history), 
            and spent 8 days hiking the North Coast Trail (among many other hikes)!</p>
            <p>I've also spent time learning about <a className="external-link" href="http://paulgraham.com/weird.html">weird programming languages</a> and trying to improve 
            my mental models around what makes a programming language good for a given situation.</p>
            <p className="title-2">What's Next</p>
            <p>I'm trying to figure out how I want to spend my time moving forwards. One important part of this is what I want to do for work: I'm interested in infrastructure
            and DevOps. The other is what side projects I want to be working on. Most of the ideas on my to-do list involve automating workflows, or setting up open source tools
            on servers that I run.</p>
