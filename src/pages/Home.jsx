            <p className="title-2">About Me</p>
            <p>As a developer, I am passionate about automating workflows and protecting data. I believe that software can
            help everyone increase the impact of their work, but that you need to build systems that do the basics properly. 
            If your tool doesn't make someone's life easier, then they won't use it. If your tool exposes someone's private 
            data, then they will stop using it. </p>
            <p>As a human being, I care about how our technology affects our society. From democratizing knowledge to the rise of 
            purposeful misinformation, we can see that technologies have broad and important effects. If you aren't thoughtful about
            how a technology will be used, or aware of history, then all too often what you build will have negative effects on our 
            society.</p>
            <p>I have a B.Sc. in Computer Science from the University of Victoria, where I focused on building software infrastructure and understanding the 
            effects that software systems can have on our society.</p>
